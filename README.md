# cowry_ids

Build a simple API that will return a key-value pair of randomly generated UUID. Key will be a timestamp and value will be UUID. While the server is running, whenever the API is called, it should return all the previous UUIDs ever generated by the API alongside a new UUID. Push the code to a git repository and share the link to the repo.*
Sample (note that the latest uuid is at the top).

```bash
{
    "2021-06-15 22:55:09.011526": "c98c14fab05b4ad893ce1aa4fdb5a081",
